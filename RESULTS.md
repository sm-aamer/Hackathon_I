## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- Docusaurus-based static site for documentation
- Modular content structure by Isaac technology areas
- RAG-ready content organization for AI integration
- GitHub Pages deployment strategy

### Content Structure
- Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
  - Chapter 1: Isaac Sim Essentials (photoreal simulation, synthetic data)
  - Chapter 2: Isaac ROS Integration (accelerated VSLAM, perception pipelines)
  - Chapter 3: Nav2 for Humanoids (path planning, navigation workflow)

### Key Features
- Photorealistic simulation with Isaac Sim
- Hardware-accelerated perception with Isaac ROS
- Humanoid-aware navigation with Nav2
- Synthetic data generation for AI training
- GPU-accelerated processing workflows

## Quality Assurance
- All constitution checks passed
- Specification quality validated
- Task dependencies properly identified
- Parallel execution opportunities maximized
- Independent testing capabilities maintained for each user story

## Next Steps
With the foundation complete, implementation can proceed with:
1. Setting up the Docusaurus project structure
2. Creating the Isaac-specific documentation content
3. Validating content with the specified acceptance criteria
4. Testing each user story independently

## Impact
This implementation provides a complete foundation for teaching advanced robotics concepts using NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem, enabling students to learn about photorealistic simulation, accelerated perception, and humanoid navigation in a structured, RAG-ready format.
