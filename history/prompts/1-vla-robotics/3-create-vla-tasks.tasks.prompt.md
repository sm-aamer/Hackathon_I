## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task breakdown for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module with 52 specific tasks organized by phases: Setup (3 tasks), Foundational (5 tasks), User Story 1 (10 tasks), User Story 2 (9 tasks), User Story 3 (9 tasks), and Polish phase (16 tasks). Tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown created for VLA robotics documentation implementation
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 2 files created/updated (tasks.md, CLAUDE.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to implementation phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Well-structured task list with clear dependencies and parallelization opportunities

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
