# Introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA), where you'll learn about LLM-driven robotics and natural-language control. This module focuses on voice-to-action pipelines, cognitive planning with LLMs, and the Autonomous Humanoid capstone project.

## Overview

In this module, you will explore how modern robotics systems integrate vision, language, and action to create intelligent, responsive robots that can understand and execute natural language commands. We'll cover:

- Voice-to-Action systems using Whisper API
- Cognitive planning with Large Language Models
- Autonomous humanoid systems that integrate all components

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completed Modules 1-3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts and navigation
- Familiarity with simulation environments (Gazebo/Isaac Sim)
- Access to a humanoid robot or simulator

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Implement voice-controlled robot systems
2. Use LLMs for cognitive planning and task decomposition
3. Create autonomous humanoid systems that respond to natural language
4. Integrate vision, language, and action components into cohesive systems
